# Git Tutorial Overview

This repository is for a git tutorial presentation on 2023-11-07. The exercises in the linked repositories are intended to give someone new to git a rudimentary understanding of some of git's basic features. The linked tutorials aren't dependent on any specific ui for git but are written with both the command line and Microsoft's Visual Studio Code in mind. 

## Preparation

1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
